* Add '^' and '$' to search operations
* Make the 'download' links work
  * Possibly implement some smarter cache calculation?
* Allow submissions in .txt or .bz2 format
* Get rid of (or fix) the Password.c_hash_count column (again)
* Figure out why hash:password submission format gives slightly invalid results
* Check if each_chunk has an off-by-one error (ie, if it's processing fields multiple times)
