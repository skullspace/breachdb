Basically, all that's left is to release a beta and see how it goes!
* Clean up the web page a bit, if necessary
  * Definitely need to clean up the /downloads page
* Look into logging in Sinatra
* Put some beta instructions at the top
* Import some real data
* Look over and sanity check pages
* Import a bunch of real data
* Ask for beta testers!!!
