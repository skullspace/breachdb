Basically, all that's left is to release a beta and see how it goes!
* Clean up the web page a bit, if necessary
  * Definitely need to clean up the /downloads page
* Put some beta instructions at the top
* Look over and sanity check pages
* Ask for beta testers!!!
* Stop showing plaintext on 'hash' pages
* Searching for hashes is too slow
* Implemented LinkedIn-SHA1
* Figure out why bcrypt isn't working
* Look at the TODO notes in the codebase
