* Add '^' and '$' to search operations
* Make the 'download' links work
* Verify the order of @all_classes in breachdb_admin.rb to ensure that the caches are updated properly (by looking at the update_class function)
  * Possibly implement some smarter cache calculation?
  * It doesn't look like part of the caching is working - for example, masks aren't being generated (I don't think the code for doing the masks even existss anymore, in fact)
* Create some proper testing (3 or 4 smaller breaches, a good list of submissions)
* Allow submissions in .txt or .bz2 format
