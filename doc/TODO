* Submissions
  * Finish submissions
  * Allow submissions in .txt or .bz2 format
* Dictionaries
  * Add to Web interface
  * Update masks to incorporate dictionaries
* Go through the tables and make sure that the values make sense
* Rename fields to get rid of prefix?
* Make the db reconnect automatically if it goes away
* Make sure submissions from the web are giving credit to the right cracker and generating an appropriate submissionbatch
* We can probably split Submissions.import_submissions() into two functions, depending on whether you give a name or an id for the submission batch
