If you want to run your own BreachDB service, you're totally welcome to
(particularly for testing / development, I imagine). It just takes a few steps
to set up (since I wrote this for myself and not for others). Basically:

- Create a MySQL database, and create a user with select/update/insert
  permissions

- In the db/ folder, there's a file called breachdb.sql; import it with the
  following command:
  $ mysql -u root -p -D <database name> < breacndb.sql

- Create a file in your home directory called auth.rb that looks like this:
  DB_HOST='localhost'
  DB_USERNAME='breachdb'
  DB_PASSWORD='breachdb_password'
  DB_DB='breachdb'

- Run web.rb:
  ruby ./web.rb

You should be good to go!

If you want to take advantage of some test data I wrote, do this:

- Create a MySQL database called breachdb_test

- Create a user called breachdb_test with the password breachdb_test and grant
it full access to the breachdb_test database

- cd test ; ./test.sh

That should load a bunch of test data into the database and get it going. 
You can then use:

- cd test ; ./test_web.sh

To fire up a web server that points to that test database.
