If you want to run your own BreachDB service, you're totally welcome to
(particularly for testing / development, I imagine). It just takes a few steps
to set up (since I wrote this for myself and not for others). Basically:

- Create a MySQL database, and create a user with select/update/insert
  permissions

- In the db/ folder, there's a file called breachdb.sql; import it with the
  following command:
  $ mysql -u root -p -D <database name> < breacndb.sql

- Create a file in your home directory called auth.rb that looks like this:
  DB_HOST='localhost'
  DB_USERNAME='breachdb'
  DB_PASSWORD='breachdb_password'
  DB_DB='breachdb'

- Run web.rb:
  ruby ./web.rb

You should be good to go!
